/*
 * IMPORTANT CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
 * -------------------------------------
 * For local development, you need to create an `appsettings.Development.json` file in the same directory as your `appsettings.json`.
 * This file should not be checked into source control to protect sensitive information such as API keys and tokens.
 *
 * Your `appsettings.Development.json` should include the following structure to configure local secrets for development purposes:
 *
 * {
 *   "Secrets": {
 *     "DiscordToken": "<Your_Discord_Bot_Token_Here>",
 *     "OpenAIKey": "<Your_OpenAI_API_Key_Here>"
 *   },
 *   "ConnectionStrings": {
 *     "DefaultConnection": <Your_Local_Db_Instance>
 *   }
 * }
 *
 *
 *  * Set the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` variable to `Development` in your environment or within your IDE's debug settings. 
 *  * This instructs the ASP.NET Core framework to load the `appsettings.Development.json` file and apply its configurations.
 *  * EX) For Visual Studio: Go to your project properties -> Debug tab -> Open Debug Launch Profiles UI -> 
 *  * Environment Variables section and add `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` with the value `Development`
 *  
 *
 *  * Please replace `<Your_Discord_Token_Here>` and `<Your_OpenAI_API_Key_Here>` with your actual Discord bot token and OpenAI API key.
 *  * 
 *  * Please configure LocalDB for development purposes:
 
              MariaDB Windows Installation and Migration Guide
              
              ## Part 1: Installing MariaDB
              
              ### Download MariaDB
              1. Navigate to the official MariaDB download page: https://mariadb.org/download/
              2. Download the installer package to your local machine
              
              ### Verify Installation
              1. Open Command Prompt as administrator
              
              2. Verify MariaDB service is running:
                 sc query MySQL
              
              3. Test MariaDB connection:
                 mysql -u root -p
                 Enter your root password when prompted. You should see the MariaDB prompt:
                 MariaDB [(none)]>
              
              ## Part 2: Running Migration Scripts
              
              ### Preparing for Migration
              1. Locate your migration script file
              2. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory containing your script:
                 cd path\to\your\script\directory
              
              ### Execute Migration Script
              1. Basic method (for simple scripts):
                 mysql -u root -p database_name < migration_script.sql
              
              2. Alternative method (for monitoring execution):
              
                 mysql -u root -p
              
                 Then at the MariaDB prompt:
              
                 USE database_name;
                 source migration_script.sql;
              
              ### Verify Migration
              After running the migration, verify its success:
              
              -- Check if tables were created
              SHOW TABLES;
